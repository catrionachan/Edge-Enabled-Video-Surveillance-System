# Edge-Enabled-Video-Surveillance-System
Research Project under Western University USRI Program

The project was in conjunction with the USRI program at Western University. It would not be possible without the ongoing support of Western Universityâ€™s Faculty of Engineering and Scholarship@Western. I would like to express my gratitude towards Dr. Xianbin Wang for his his guidance and encouragement. Many thanks to the lab group, especially Cesar, Ruitao, and Sabin for their help and willingness to teach me.

The purpose of the video surviellance system is to help reduce the network strain that is sent to the server. The files that are saved on the raspberry pi are sent through a FTP protocol to the FTP server to be accessed on the website below.
